## üîÑ Booking Flow Overview

1. **Booking Form Completed:**  
   User selects date, time, guests, addons, areas.

2. **Hold Booking:**  
   Frontend sends data to Eveve `/web/hold` API.  
   If successful, reservation is temporarily held (token returned).

3. **Display Booking Details Modal:**  
   An overlay/modal appears (not scrolling down the page).  
   Customer enters personal info (first name, last name, email, phone, notes. With additions select boxes for booking options, customer options and dietaries depending on setup).
   If payment is required, Stripe Elements is shown in this modal.

4. **Stripe Payment (Optional):**  
   A payment intent is created using your backend.  
   The frontend confirms payment using Stripe Elements.  
   On success, booking proceeds.

5. **Confirm Booking:**  
   After successful form input (and optional payment), send to Eveve `/web/book` API to finalise.
